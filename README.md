# Curriculum vitae

This is how i manage my resumes.
I use [LaTeX](https://www.latex-project.org/) as the markup language and compile them to pdfs.
Makefiles are great for automating boring and repetitive commands.

### Compilation

```sh
git clone https://github.com/le0flo/curriculum.git
cd curriculum
make
```
